    "# 1) The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and structure code by representing real-world entities, concepts, or objects as software objects. It aims to improve code reusability, maintainability, and modularity by encapsulating data and behavior within objects and allowing them to interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) In Python, an object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects are created from classes and can have their unique attributes and behavior while sharing the structure defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) A class in Python is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects that belong to it. A class can have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) Attributes in a class represent the data or properties of the class. They are variables associated with the class and can store information specific to each instance of the class. Methods, on the other hand, are functions defined within the class that perform operations on the class's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) Class variables are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. They are defined at the class level and have the same value for all instances. Instance variables, on the other hand, are specific to each instance of the class. They are defined within methods and hold unique values for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6) The self parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It is a convention in Python to name this parameter \"self\" (though you can technically use any name), and it allows you to access and modify the attributes and methods of the instance within the class. When you call a method on an object, Python automatically passes the instance (self) as the first argument to that method.\n",
